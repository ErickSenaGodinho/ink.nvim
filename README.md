Create a configuration file (e.g., `~/.config/nvim/after/plugin/ink.lua`) with your settings.

Here's the complete default configuration with comments explaining each option:

```lua
require("ink").setup({
  -- Display settings
  focused_mode = true,    -- Enable focused reading mode
  image_open = true,      -- Allow opening images in external viewer
  justify_text = false,   -- Enable text justification (adds spaces between words)
  max_width = 120,        -- Maximum text width (for centering)
  width_step = 10,        -- How much to change width per keypress

  -- Navigation keymaps
  keymaps = {
    next_chapter = "]c",            -- Navigate to next chapter

    -- purple = "<leader>hp",    -- Highlight with your custom highlight
  },

  -- Note keymaps (for annotations on highlights)
  note_keymaps = {
    add = "<leader>na",           -- Add/edit note on highlight under cursor
    remove = "<leader>nd",        -- Remove note from highlight
    toggle_display = "<leader>nt" -- Toggle note display (off/indicator/expanded)
  },

  -- Bookmark keymaps
  bookmark_keymaps = {
    add = "<leader>ba",           -- Add/edit bookmark at paragraph

### Data Storage

All plugin data is stored in `~/.local/share/nvim/ink.nvim/`:

```
~/.local/share/nvim/ink.nvim/
├── library.json              # Library metadata (all books)
├── cache/                    # Extracted EPUB contents
│   └── {book-slug}/          # Cached files per book
└── books/                    # Per-book user data
    └── {book-slug}/
        ├── state.json        # Reading position (chapter, line)
        ├── highlights.json   # User highlights and notes
        └── bookmarks.json    # Bookmarks for this book
```

- **library.json**: Tracks all opened books with metadata and last read position
- **cache/{slug}/**: Extracted EPUB files (HTML, images, CSS)
- **books/{slug}/**: User-specific data that persists across sessions

### Search Features

The search features integrate with Telescope to provide powerful book navigation:

**Chapter Search (`<leader>pit`):**
- Shows all chapters immediately with previews
- Type to filter by chapter name
- Press `<CR>` to jump to selected chapter
- Press `<C-f>` to switch to content search

**Content Search (`<leader>pif`):**
- Live grep across all chapter content
- Type to search for text (shows results as you type)
- Press `<CR>` to jump to the exact line in that chapter
- Press `<C-f>` to switch back to chapter search

### Using Highlights

1. Enter visual mode (`v` or `V`)
2. Select text you want to highlight
3. Press a highlight keymap (e.g., `<leader>hy` for yellow)
4. To remove a highlight, place cursor on highlighted text and press `<leader>hd`

**Highlight Features:**
- **Persistent**: Saved across sessions
- **Book-specific**: Each EPUB has its own highlights
- **Non-destructive**: Don't modify the original EPUB file
- **Customizable**: Add unlimited colors in config

**Adding Custom Colors:**
You can add unlimited highlight colors by adding entries to both `highlight_colors` and `highlight_keymaps`:

## Testing
