# ink.nvim

> A minimalist, distraction-free EPUB and Markdown reader for Neovim.

Read books and documents without leaving your editor. Full support for EPUB files and Markdown documents with persistent highlights, notes, bookmarks, and powerful search capabilities.

**Non-destructive**: All annotations (highlights, notes, bookmarks) are stored separately and never modify your original files.

**Quick Start:**
```vim
:InkOpen book.epub          " Open EPUB
:InkOpen document.md        " Open Markdown
:InkLibrary                 " Browse your library
```

- **Continuous scrolling** per chapter
- **Navigable table of contents**
- **Telescope integration** for searching chapters and content
- **Syntax-highlighted text** rendered from HTML
- **Progress tracking** and restoration
- **Image extraction** and external viewing
- **External links**: Open URLs in browser with confirmation dialog
- **Internal links**: Navigate between sections and chapters (preview or jump)
- **User highlights** with customizable colors (persistent across sessions)
- **Notes on highlights** (add annotations to your highlights)
- **Bookmarks** with navigation (multiple bookmarks per paragraph, jump between bookmarks across chapters)
- **Text justification** (optional, toggle on/off)
- **Footnote preview** with floating windows
- **Library management** (browse, search, track reading progress)
- **Export highlights** and bookmarks to Markdown or JSON
- **Smart caching** for EPUBs with automatic invalidation
- **Cache management** UI for cleaning up cached files

- Generated table of contents from headings
- All reading features work: highlights, bookmarks, notes, search, export
- Internal links navigate across chapters
- Images and external links supported
- Progress tracking and library management

**Markdown-specific:**
- Virtual chapters created from heading structure
- TOC built from H1-H3 headings
- Internal links work globally (e.g., `[link](#section)` jumps to section anywhere in file)
- Images resolved relative to .md file location

**Usage:**
```vim
:InkOpen ~/notes/book.md
```

All features (highlights, bookmarks, notes, export) work identically to EPUBs.

### Export

Export your highlights, notes, and bookmarks to share or archive:

**Interactive Export:**
```vim
:InkExport
```

Prompts for:
- Format: `md` (Markdown) or `json`
- Options: `-b` (include bookmarks), `-c` (include context)
- Output path (defaults to `~/Documents`)

**Export Format Examples:**

Command: `:InkExport md -bc ~/exports/`
Result: `~/exports/book-title-2024-01-15.md`

**Markdown Export includes:**
- Book metadata (title, author, language, etc.)
- Statistics (highlights count, notes count, bookmarks count)
- Highlights grouped by chapter with color indication
- Optional: Context lines around each highlight
- Optional: Bookmarks with text previews
- Notes displayed inline with highlights

**JSON Export:**
Structured data for programmatic use, includes all metadata and content.

**Keymap:** `<leader>ex` opens export dialog for current book.

### Cache Management

EPUBs are extracted to cache for faster loading. Manage cache with:

**Interactive UI:**
```vim
:InkClearCache
```
Shows list of cached books with Telescope or floating menu. Select a book to clear its cache, or press `<C-a>` (Telescope) or `a` (floating) to clear all.

**Direct Commands:**
```vim
:InkClearCache --all          " Clear all cache (with confirmation)
:InkClearCache book-slug      " Clear specific book
:InkCacheInfo                 " Show cache stats
```

**Cache Features:**
- Automatic invalidation when EPUB is modified
- Extraction flag prevents incomplete cache usage
- Per-book storage in `~/.local/share/nvim/ink.nvim/cache/{slug}/`

### Data Storage

All plugin data is stored in `~/.local/share/nvim/ink.nvim/`:

```
~/.local/share/nvim/ink.nvim/
├── library.json              # Library metadata (all books)
├── cache/                    # Extracted EPUB contents
│   └── {book-slug}/
│       ├── .extracted        # Extraction flag (timestamp)
│       └── ...               # Extracted files (HTML, images, CSS)
└── books/                    # Per-book user data
    └── {book-slug}/
        ├── state.json        # Reading position (chapter, line)
        ├── highlights.json   # User highlights and notes
        ├── bookmarks.json    # Bookmarks for this book
        └── toc_cache.json    # Cached TOC (for EPUBs without built-in TOC)
```

**File Descriptions:**
- **library.json**: Tracks all opened books (EPUB/Markdown) with metadata, format, and progress
- **cache/{slug}/**: Extracted EPUB files (HTML, images, CSS) with automatic invalidation
- **cache/{slug}/.extracted**: Timestamp flag to track cache freshness
- **books/{slug}/state.json**: Reading position (chapter index and line number)
- **books/{slug}/highlights.json**: User highlights with colors, notes, and context
- **books/{slug}/bookmarks.json**: Bookmarks with names and text previews
- **books/{slug}/toc_cache.json**: Generated TOC cache for performance

**Note:** Markdown files don't use cache (no extraction needed). All user data (highlights, bookmarks, notes) is stored the same way for both EPUBs and Markdown files.

### Search Features

The search features integrate with Telescope to provide powerful book navigation:

**Chapter Search (`<leader>pit`):**
- Shows all chapters immediately with previews
- Type to filter by chapter name
- Press `<CR>` to jump to selected chapter
- Press `<C-f>` to switch to content search

**Content Search (`<leader>pif`):**
- Live grep across all chapter content
- Type to search for text (shows results as you type)
- Press `<CR>` to jump to the exact line in that chapter
- Press `<C-f>` to switch back to chapter search

### Using Highlights

1. Enter visual mode (`v` or `V`)
2. Select text you want to highlight
3. Press a highlight keymap (e.g., `<leader>hy` for yellow)
4. To change color, place cursor on highlight and press change keymap (e.g., `<leader>hcr` for red)
5. To remove a highlight, place cursor on highlighted text and press `<leader>hd`

**Highlight Features:**
- **Persistent**: Saved across sessions
- **Book-specific**: Each EPUB has its own highlights
- **Non-destructive**: Don't modify the original EPUB file
- **Customizable**: Add unlimited colors in config
- **Color changing**: Change highlight color without recreating (preserves notes)

## Testing

A comprehensive test EPUB (and MD) (`ink-test.epub(.md)`) is included to demonstrate all features:

```vim
:InkOpen ink-test.epub
:InkOpen ink-test.md
```

All features (TOC, highlights, bookmarks, notes, search, export) work the same as EPUBs.
