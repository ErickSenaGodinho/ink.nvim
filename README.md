# ink.nvim

> A minimalist, distraction-free EPUB and Markdown reader for Neovim.

Read books and documents without leaving your editor. Full support for EPUB files and Markdown documents with persistent highlights, notes, bookmarks, glossary system, and powerful search capabilities.

**Non-destructive**: All annotations (highlights, notes, bookmarks, glossary) are stored separately and never modify your original files.

**Quick Start:**
```vim
:InkOpen book.epub          " Open EPUB
:InkOpen document.md        " Open Markdown
:InkLibrary                 " Browse your library
:InkDashboard               " View reading statistics
```

## Features

### Reading
